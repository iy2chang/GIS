 Administer services created by the AdvancedEJB sample. This package provides 
functionality to search, add, remove, and update a map service of AdvancedEJB. 
It provides a standalone application to fulfill those functionalities. AdvancedEJBAdmin is the main class, while the remaining three classes are developed
to provide three main functions: add a service, list all services, and show
service details (where two functions are enabling, removing, or updating the
service).&nbsp;
